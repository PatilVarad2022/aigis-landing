    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p><strong>No Guarantee of Returns:</strong> Aigis does not guarantee profits or returns. All investments carry risk, and market volatility may result in losses. Our AI is a tool for disciplined risk management and decision augmentation, not a guarantee against market downturns.</p>
    <p><strong>Accountability:</strong> We accept responsibility if our system fails to follow your explicit <em>Mandate</em> (e.g., the software fails to trigger the Principal Loss Shield despite the mandate being active).</p>
    <p><strong>Fees:</strong> After the 28‑day free trial, a low, flat monthly subscription fee applies for continued access to the autonomous Agent.</p>
    <p><strong>Compliance:</strong> We are not yet SEBI registered. We are committed to building a compliance‑first platform and aligning with applicable SEBI and Indian data protection regulations.</p>
